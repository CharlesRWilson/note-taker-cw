# Note Taker

## Description

The purpose of this project was to make an application that allowed you to take notes and save them to your database and then display those notes for later viewing. This project was great to help me get some practice with using servers and deplying to Render!

## Installation

Just use the [render link!](https://note-taker-cw.onrender.com/)

## Usage

On page open there is a button to get started. It then takes you to a page where you can input a note title and as well as the content. Then you should be able to save your notes and see them on the left hand side.
